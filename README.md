# DukeMTMC-VideoReID

DukeMTMC-VideoReID is a subset of the [DukeMTMC](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/) for video-based re-identification.

We crop pedestrian images from the videos for 12 frames every second to generate a tracklet. The dataset is split following 
the protocol in [DukeMTMC-reID](https://github.com/layumi/DukeMTMC-reID_evaluation), i.e., 702 identities for training, 702 
identities for testing, and 408 identities as the distractors. Totally, we generate 369,656 frames of 2,196 tracklets for 
training, and 445,764 frames of 2,636 tracklets for testing and distractors.
In the testing set, we pick one query tracklet for each ID in each camera and put the remaining tracklets in the gallery. 


### About Dataset
|File  | Description | 
| --------   | -----  |
|./train_split  | The training tracklets. It contains 702 identities.|
|./query_split  | The query tracklets. Each of them is from different identities in different cameras.|
|./gallery_split  | The gallery_split tracklets.|

**Directory Structure.** Followings is the directory structure for DukeMTMC-VideoReID. 
> Splits
>> Person ids
>>> Tracklet ids
>>>> Frame images


**Naming Rules.** For frame "0001C6F0099X30823.jpg" from tracklet id 0003 of person id 0001,
"0001" is the identity. "C6" indicate it from Camera 6. "F0099" means it is the 99th frame in the tracklet. 
"X30823" is the 30823th frame in the video of Camera 6.
